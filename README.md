This repository contains the Single Page Application, similarly imitating the Avon and Somerset website, which pulls in data from a JSON file to populate the page.

The application is based on the Javascript templating framework 'Handlebars', as well as Bootstrap for styling and includes dependencies such jQuery.

Running the application can be easily carried out by opening the 'index.html' which should display as mentioned, a similar layout to the website.

Although the JSON file is included in the folder, the file is being pulled from a json storage server.

Have fun!
